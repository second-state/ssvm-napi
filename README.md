# Second State WebAssembly VM for Node.js Addon

The [Second State VM (SSVM)](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm) is a high performance WebAssembly runtime optimized for server side applications. This project provides support for accessing SSVM as a Node.js addon. It allows Node.js applications to call WebAssembly functions written in Rust or other high performance languages. [Why do you want to run WebAssembly on the server-side?](https://docs.secondstate.io/serverless-cloud/the-case-for-webassembly-on-the-server-side) The SSVM addon could interact with the wasm files generated by the [ssvmup](https://github.com/second-state/ssvmup) compiler tool.

## NOTICE

SSVM Node.js Addon is in active development.

In current stage, our prebuilt version **only supports** `Boost 1.65.1` and x64 Linux.
If you want to use other version of Boost library, you could use `--build-from-source` flag during addon installation.


## Setup for Rust, Nodejs, and ssvmup

```
$ apt-get update
$ apt install -y build-essential

$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env

$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash

$ nvm install v10.19.0
$ nvm use v10.19.0

$ npm i -g ssvmup
```


## Create new project

```
cargo new --lib hello
cd hello
```

## Change the cargo config file

Add the following to the `Cargo.toml` file.

```
[lib]
name = "hello"
path = "src/lib.rs"
crate-type =["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.50"
```

## Write Rust code

Below is the entire content of the `src/lib.rs` file.

```
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn say(s: String) -> String {
  let r = String::from("hello ");
  return r + &s;
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn reverse(v: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut r = v.clone();
    r.reverse();
    return r;
}
```

## Build the WASM bytecode

```
ssvmup build
```

After building, our target wasm file is located at `pkg/hello_bg.wasm`.

## Requirements for SSVM addon

```
apt update
apt install -y build-essential libboost-all-dev
```

## Install SSVM addon for your application

```
npm install ssvm
```

or if you want to build from source:

```
npm install --build-from-source https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-napi
```

## Use SSVM addon

After installing SSVM addon, we could now interact with `hello_bg.wasm` generated by wasm-pack in Node.js.
Make sure you use the corresponding vm method to rust return type.

- Create a new folder at any path you want. (e.g. `mkdir application`)
- Copy `hello_bg.wasm` into your application directory. (e.g. `cp hello_gb.wasm <path_to_your_application_folder>`)
- Create js file `main.js` (or whatever you like) with the following content:

```
var ssvm = require('ssvm');
var vm = new ssvm.VM("hello_bg.wasm")
var ret = vm.RunString("say", "world");
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunInt("add", 3, 4);
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunUint8Array("reverse", Uint8Array.from([1, 2, 3]));
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunInt("add", 999, -111);
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunUint8Array("reverse", Uint8Array.from([30, 20, 10]));
console.log(ret);
```

## Execute and check results

```
$ node main.js

hello world
7
Uint8Array [ 3, 2, 1 ]
888
Uint8Array [ 10, 20, 30 ]
```
