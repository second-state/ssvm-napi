# SSVM Node.js Addon

In this example, we setup a `string` hello world WASM demo and demonstrate interaction with the SSVM addon. Since the `string` type is NOT natively supported by WASM, our SSVM addon could interact with the wasm files generated by `wasm-pack` and `wasm-bindgen`.

## NOTICE

SSVM Node.js Addon is active development.

In current stage, our project based on `Ubuntu 18.04` and `Boost 1.65.1`.


## Setup for Rust utilities

```
apt-get update
apt install -y build-essential
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
```


## Create new project

```
cargo new --lib hello
cd hello
```

## Change the cargo config file

Add the following to the `Cargo.toml` file.

```
[lib]
name = "hello"
path = "src/lib.rs"
crate-type =["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.50"
```

## Write Rust code

Below is the entire content of the `src/lib.rs` file.

```
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn say(s: String) -> String {
  let r = String::from("hello ");
  return r + &s;
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn reverse(v: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut r = v.clone();
    r.reverse();
    return r;
}
```

## Build the WASM bytecode

```
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

After building, our target wasm file is located at `pkg/hello_bg.wasm`.

## Setup for SSVM-napi requirement

```
# Dependencies for SSVM-core
apt update && apt install -y \
  libboost-all-dev
```

## Use SSVM addon

After building SSVM addon, we could now interact with `hello_bg.wasm` generated by wasm-pack in Node.js.
Make sure you use the corresponding vm method to rust return type.

- Create a new folder at any path you want. (e.g. `mkdir application`)
- Copy `hello_bg.wasm` into your application directory. (e.g. `cp hello_gb.wasm <path_to_your_application_folder>`)
- Create js file `main.js` (or whatever you like) with the following content:

```
var ssvm = require('ssvm');
var vm = new ssvm.VM("hello_bg.wasm")
var ret = vm.RunString("say", "world");
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunInt("add", 3, 4);
console.log(ret);

ret = vm.RunUint8Array("reverse", Uint8Array.from([1, 2, 3]));
console.log(ret);
```

## Install SSVM addon for your application

```
npm install ssvm@0.1.0
```

## Execute and check results

```
node main.js

...ommited...

hello world

...ommited...

7

...ommited...

Uint8Array(3) [ 3, 2, 1 ]
```
